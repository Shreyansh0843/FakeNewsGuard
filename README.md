# ðŸŽ¯ What This Solves
- **Problem:**
  Misinformation spreads 6x faster than real news on social media. Manual fact-checking can't keep up.

- **Solution:** This system automatically
  - Classifies news articles as real/fake with 77% accuracy using BERT
  - Provides confidence scores and probability breakdowns
  - Processes articles in real-time (< 1 second per article)
  - Explains classification decisions with attention mechanisms Built on a curated dataset of          10,000+ verified news articles with ground truth labels.

# âš¡ Quick Demo

- **Run in Google Colab (recommended):**
  - Upload Fake_News_Detector.ipynb to Google Colab
  - Upload your True.csv and Fake.csv datasets
  - Run all cells - everything installs automatically
  - Get instant results with the interactive Gradio demo
Test with your own articles: Just paste any news text into the interface
